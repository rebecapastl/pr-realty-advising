# PR Realty Advising

This is a project for the course CPSC 2221 - Database - Langara College - Summer of 2020, whose purpose was to design a Real Estate management database.

The database was designed and developed in a group project, where we have gone through all the steps of the design process such as drawing the ER diagram, relational mapping, normalization.
